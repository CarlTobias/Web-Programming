        <strong>1. </strong>Someone's mom is currently using you as either a good or bad example for her kids.
        <strong>2. </strong>Birthday presents are your rewards for not dying that year.
        <strong>3. </strong>Why are prisoners given food and water, but the homeless aren't?
        <strong>4. </strong>There's no way to prove that we all see the same colours.

        <strong>6. </strong>Your belly button used to be your mouth.
        <strong>7. </strong>How does your tongue know how something will feel when you look at it?
        <strong>8. </strong>If you work at a farm and you take care of chickens, then that makes you a "chicken tneder."
        <strong>9. </strong>The skeleton isn't inside you, you're the brain, so you're the one inside the skeleton.
        <strong>10. </strong>My debit card pays for things with past hours of my life, while my credit card pays with the future hours of my life.
